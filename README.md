## how to play

To play this keyboard you must have a standard computer keyboard. to play any note(the notation is in Indian classical format):
```
    1 = sa
    2 = re
    3 = ga
    4 = ma
    5 = pa
    6 = dha
    7 = ni
    8 = sa`

    @ = komol re
    # = komol ga
    $ = kori ma
    ^ = komol dha
    & = komol ni
```


## Customize
To customize the keyboard in code mind these 3 variables

### delay

The variable ***delay*** controls the time for a note will be played. Manipulate it's value to make the note longer or shorter

### keynote

The array keynote consists the frequencies of different notes in first octave. 

### octave

Octave controls the octave which the keyboard will play. the defaul is set to 4. 

So the sa will be played in 32.7 * 4 = 130.8
